### HELIOS - Hazard Exploration and Lifesaving Intelligent Operations System

**Overview:**
HELIOS is an advanced, autonomous drone platform designed to revolutionize search and rescue (SAR) operations in hazardous environments. Equipped with cutting-edge robotics, machine learning, and sensor technologies, HELIOS is built to efficiently locate and assist survivors in environments where human intervention is challenging or dangerous. 

**Core Technologies:**
- **ROS2 & Gazebo**: For robot programming, control, and real-time simulation, allowing for extensive testing and deployment in both simulated and real environments.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Enables HELIOS to autonomously map and navigate unknown environments in real-time, critical for GPS-denied areas such as caves, forests, or collapsed buildings.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Allows the drone to learn optimal navigation paths through trial and error, improving performance in complex and dynamic scenarios over time.
- **Computer Vision**: Uses advanced vision algorithms for real-time object detection, victim identification, and terrain analysis to support search and rescue operations.
- **RRT Algorithm**: Implements Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*) for efficient path planning, allowing HELIOS to calculate safe and optimal routes while avoiding obstacles.
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Integrates data from cameras, LiDAR, infrared sensors, and microphones to detect survivors through debris, in low-visibility conditions, or in difficult terrains.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Navigation**: Utilizes reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt flight paths and decision-making based on mission objectives and environmental factors.

**Key Features:**
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Combines SLAM and RRT* algorithms to autonomously explore, map, and navigate through cluttered, complex environments while avoiding obstacles.
- **Adaptive Search Strategy**: Uses reinforcement learning to optimize search patterns, prioritizing high-probability areas for finding survivors based on terrain and previous missions.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Future enhancements will enable multiple HELIOS drones to work together in coordinated rescue efforts, sharing maps and data to cover large areas more efficiently.
- **Object Detection and Victim Identification**: Integrates computer vision with infrared and LiDAR sensors to detect human presence, hazardous objects, or potential survivors even in low-visibility conditions.

**Current Status:**
In active development, currently focused on setting up and refining ROS2 and Gazebo-based simulation environments. Work is underway to implement SLAM-based autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and reinforcement learning for adaptive path planning.

**Future Goals:**
- **Real-Time Video Streaming with AI Analysis**: Implementing advanced video streaming for improved rescue team monitoring, with AI to assist in real-time footage analysis for hidden patterns or survivors.
- **Multi-Drone Swarm Capabilities**: Expanding the system to support coordination among multiple HELIOS drones, allowing for synchronized SAR operations in larger areas.
- **Emergency Supply Delivery**: Design to carry and deploy critical supplies, such as medical kits, food, and communication devices, to survivors in remote or hard-to-reach areas.
- **Energy-Efficient Power Management**: Utilize intelligent power management systems to maximize flight duration by optimizing battery usage based on mission requirements and environmental conditions.

**Repository:**
Coming Soon!
